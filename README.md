# CompactCTF
This is essentially a discord bot that will simulate a small scale CTF competition with challenges based on cybersecurity practices. Currently, I just have very basic discord to python integration functional, with the challenges and flags simply being stored in a dictionary in the code of it(which kind of defeats the purpose of the whole thing, if people can just look up the answers here, then what's the point?)
I need to find a way to be able to store the challenges offsite, in a different location from this repo, in a secure place where nobody other than me can see the full picture(both challenges and answers to those challenges.)
Would also love to some leaderboard functionality to the bot so it can keep track of the scores of people within the server, make it an actual competition with bragging rights.
